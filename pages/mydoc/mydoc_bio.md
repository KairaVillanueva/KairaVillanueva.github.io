## Biography

Kaira Villanueva, b.1991, is a multimedia artist in New Jersey. She has participated in group exhibitions at the Bruce Museum (CT), Columbia University (NY), NYC Poetry Festival (NY), Smush Gallery (NJ), House of Shadows (FL), Volition Gallery (NY), Fusion Artist Residency (Kaga, Japan), Maritime Garage Gallery (CT), and Artists of Today (NY). Kaira Villanueva earned her undergraduate degree in human rights at Columbia University, in which she researched the role of user experience design in risk communication and public interest. Her background in technology and games eventually led her to pursue world-building and extrapolating narratives through painting, sculpture, and new media. Previously, she was a Forbes 30 under 30 for game design and currently participates as a NASA Datanaut, creating tool-kits for creative exploration, such as tutorials for turning data into sound.

Her art explores ecology, spirituality, and psychological landscape themes through surreal and sometimes fear-tinged narratives, often reduced to atmospheric experiences or analogous character and environment concepts. Kaira often receives comments such as "weird, in a good way" or "a bit creepy," which is not surprising as her childhood activities included plenty of playing survival-horror games and begging her babysitters to share ghost and cryptid stories.

She aspires to assemble the sensation of discovering Pandora's box in the International Space Station while watching the sun simmer the earth into a new evolution. Overall, she loves bantering about the origins of humankind and mythological identities and taking care of the planet.
